Paper Replicated
Angrist, Joshua D., and Alan B. Krueger. “Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings?”
Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106(4), 1991.

The goal of this project is to replicate Figure I and Table VI from Angrist & Krueger (1991), which use quarter of birth as an instrumental variable to estimate the returns to education.
Specifically, I focused on:

Figure I:
Years of Education and Season of Birth, 1930–1939 (1980 Census)

Table VI:
OLS and TSLS Estimates of the Return to Education for Men Born 1940–1949 (1980 Census)
This replication uses publicly available IPUMS census microdata, cleaned using the original coding approach described in the paper.
